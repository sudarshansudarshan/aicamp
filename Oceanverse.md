# Module A
___


1.Ram and Lakshman were two brothers, Ram's pocket money was twice as much as Lakshman. The good boy that Ram and Lakshman were, they did not spend their pocket money on anything. They instead saved the same in their piggy bank. Every week, they would check their savings so far. Assume the first week's savings was $$(R_1,L_1)$$ and second week's $$(R_2,L_2)$$ and so on. They try plotting their weekly savings on a graph sheet. How will the points look like?

2.Atul's house is centered at origin $$(0,0)$$ he walks straight (along the x-axis) for 2 units and then takes a left and walks 1 unit to reach Bala's house, after that he takes a right turn and walks for one unit and then a left turn and walks for one unit and reaches Chetan's house. He continues in a similar style, takes a right turn 1 unit and then left turn one unit and reaches Divya's house. Are the houses of Bala, Chetan and Divya on a straight line? What is the equation of this line? Plot this on Geogebra

17.$$A$$ is assigned $$0$$, $$B:1$$, $$C:2$$, and so on up to $$Z:25$$<br>
Assume you denoted every letter with a number, as given in the table above.<br> You need to encrypt the word $$SUDARSHANA$$ which stands for the numbers: $$18, 20, 3, 0, 17, 18, 7, 0, 13,0$$. <br>
You encrypt this using a matrix given by : $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 2 & 3 \\3 & 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$. <br>
So $$SUDARSHANA$$ will end up becoming: $$96, 134, 6, 9, 88, 123, 14, 21, 26, 39$$. <br>
Given these numbers, how will you decrypt the message and get back $$SUDARSHANA$$?<br>. This is a well known cryptographic protocol called the Hill Cipher. You can read more online.

18.We encounter equations very often in our lives. Consider for example, the following situation at ___Baker's Cafe___. The manager has a very important estimate to make. Mostly, visitors at his cafe happen to be families and they are often comprised of Children and/or Adults. He observes that there are 3 adults and 1 child at a table and their bill turns out to be Rs.1200/-. There is yet another table with 2 children and 1 adult and their bill comes out to be Rs.1000/-. Can the manager estimate the consumption of a Child/Adult? This is popularly called the _Simultaneous Equations_ and we all remember from our school days, multiple ways in which these can be solved.<br>
   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$

19.While we were taught the so called two variables and two unknowns, what if there were more equations than unknowns?<br>
   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
   $$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$

20.Note that the previous question can be modelled as a matrix:

   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
   $$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$

   <u>Observe</u> this is same as :

   $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 3 & 1 \\1 & 2 \\1 & 1 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$
   $$\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   A\\
   C\\
   \end{matrix}
   \right)$$
   =
$$
\left(
	\begin{matrix}
	1200\\
	1000\\
	900\\
	\end{matrix}
   \right)
